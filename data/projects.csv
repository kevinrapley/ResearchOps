recIFoFmpDIGBP726,Testing with AI,Home Office Biometrics,Pre-Discovery,Goal setting & problem defining,"Problem:
Users are unclear about instructions and error messages during the address step, leading to abandonment.

Scope:
In scope: address capture and validation screens in the online flow. Out of scope: payment provider changes.

Users:
First-time visa applicants on mobile, including people using screen readers and with low bandwidth.

Research questions:
• Which parts of the address step cause confusion?
• What wording and ordering improve completion?
• What accessibility issues appear on mobile devices?

Outcomes:
Identify the top 3 blockers and reduce abandonment by 15% within the next quarter.

Method:
Discovery interviews and remote task-based usability on a clickable prototype, followed by a synthesis workshop.

Timeline:
Fieldwork in November; synthesis in early December.","[{""name"":""Kevin Rapley"",""role"":""Senior User Researcher"",""email"":""kevin.rapley@homeoffice.gov.uk""}]","Objective 1

Bilingual users face challenges when moving through the form, particularly if Welsh-speaking participants are not available in sufficient numbers. 

Scope:
In scope: exploring how bilingual users move through the form. Out of scope: payment provider changes. 

Users:
First-time visa applicants on mobile, including bilingual users, with a focus on Welsh-speaking participants. 

Outcomes:
Identify the top 3 blockers and reduce abandonment by 15% within the next quarter. 

Risks:
Recruitment risk: depends on external supplier; mitigation strategy: contingency planning. 

Method:
Discovery research involving 12 users, subject to successful recruitment. 

Constraints:
Prototype currently only works on Chrome; temporary constraint limiting testing.","[{""name"":""kevin Rapley"",""role"":""Senior User Researcher"",""email"":""kevin.rapley@homeoffice.gov.uk""}]","1) Conduct a usability study to identify the top 5 usability issues in the “apply online” form.
2) Verify that 80% of participants can complete payment without errors.
3) Measure the reduction in task completion time by 25% compared to the last release.
4) Ensure at least 3 policy stakeholders attend the playback session.","Citizen, Policeman, Analyst",,,12,,,,,,,,
